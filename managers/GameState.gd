## GameState — the live run's autosaved PROFILE + its RESPAWN point.
##
## Dark Souls style, ONE autosave (no manual slots): the run persists to user://gamestate.cfg so quitting and
## relaunching resumes where you left off. The profile is the player's progression — money, the five stats, the
## unlocked mechanics, and the backpack (items + the drawn weapon, keyed by Item.id through ItemDb) — plus the
## respawn point (the last bonfire, or the initial spawn). It is captured + written
## at every milestone: a wallet change (kill bounty / trade / pickup), a level-up, an upgrade pickup, and a
## bonfire rest. On DEATH the world is NOT reloaded — you're brought back to LIFE at the respawn point (enemies
## stay as they are); the autosave is the only thing that survives quitting.
##
## Boot: this autoload's _ready loads the save (if any) into memory, so the start menu can offer "Continue" and
## the Player's _ready can apply the loaded build. "New Game" calls reset_for_new_game() to start clean.

const SAVE_PATH := "user://gamestate.cfg"
## The five CharacterStats, by name — the columns of the [stats] save section (mirrors CharacterStats / LevelUp).
const STAT_NAMES: Array[StringName] = [&"strength", &"persuasion", &"gunplay", &"endurance", &"streetwise"]

## True once a save has been loaded into the fields below (boot found a file, or Continue was chosen). The Player's
## _ready reads this: true -> apply the saved build (stats / money / unlocks / teleport); false -> a fresh game.
var loaded: bool = false
var money: int = 100                       ## saved wallet
var stat_values: Dictionary = {}           ## StringName stat -> int; empty = all baseline (a fresh sheet)
var unlocks: Array[StringName] = []         ## the saved unlocked-mechanic ids

## The saved BACKPACK. has_inventory marks that the save carried an [inventory] section at all — an older save
## (written before inventory persisted) doesn't, and the Player then seeds its authored starting loadout instead
## of restoring an empty bag. Stacks are {id: String, count: int} in stack order (Item.id is the stable key,
## resolved back through ItemDb.restore_item); equipped_index is WHICH stack was the drawn weapon (-1 = fists).

## Load the autosave at `path` into the fields above. Returns false (and leaves loaded = false) if there's no file

## Every value reads through the type-guarded _cfg_* helpers below: this runs AT BOOT (the autoload's _ready),
## and a hand-edited/corrupt file can hold ANY Variant under a key — int() on an Array errors, `as Array` on a
## non-Array yields NULL (which would crash the restore loop), and a junk type hard-fails a typed assignment
## (respawn_position: Vector3). Junk degrades to the field's default instead of a boot crash.
